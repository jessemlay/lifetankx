 This is the source code of the LifeTank's Engine. The engine
 is in charge of the macro's logic and interface. Feel free to
 customize your LifeTank with it. You will need Visual Basic 6.0
 to edit the source code.

 A special thank goes to the Decal dev team for their quality work 
 and support on Decal through all these years, Turbine for such a
 fantastic game, and all my friends at Darkside-Online. I'd also like
 to thank the author of SkunkWorks for releasing his source code, which
 has proven to be a valuable help on several occasions throughout the
 development of lifetank. Finally, a particular thank you to Sweet Mary 
 who made LT what it is today!
